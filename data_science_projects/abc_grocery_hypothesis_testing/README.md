## Project Context

Earlier in the year, ABC Grocer ran a campaign to promote their new Delivery Club. This is a membership that costs \$100 per year, but offers free grocery deliveries rather than the normal delivery cost of \$10 per delivery.

For the campaign promoting the club, customers were put randomly into three groups;
- The first group received a low quality, low cost mailer
- The second group received a high quality, high cost mailer
- The third group received no mailer at all (control group)

The client knows that customers who were contacted, signed up for the Delivery Club at a far higher rate than the control group, but now want to understand if there is a significant difference in signup rates between the cheap mailer and the expensive mailer.  This will allow them to make more informed decisions in the future, with the overall aim of optimizing campaign ROI.
